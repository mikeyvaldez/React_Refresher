# common hooks and ones previously used in projects.
# useState - to manage the state.
# useEffect - to listen to any changes and run some sort of action based on those changes.
# useReducer - to manage complex states within our application.
# useRef - prevent unnecessary re-renders (react automatically re-renders the state of the application after any changes to the react application), also useRef references JSX Elements.
